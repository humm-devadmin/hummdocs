#Test Transactions

The following instructions outline how to perform a test transaction with humm.

> <b>Test mode</b> must be activated in the <b>humm</b> settings before proceeding.

## Performing a Test Transaction

**1.** Add a product to your cart and proceed to check out using **humm** as your payment option.

- The URL you redirect to should be **integration-cart.%domain%**. If you are redirected to another URL, you may not be in the test environment.

**2.** If you don't already have one, sign up for a **test** **humm** account, otherwise login to **humm**.

- Only test accounts will be able to sign in. Preexisting live accounts will not work.
- Please ensure your mobile number is correct as you will need to receive a verification code. All other registration information used during signup may be dummy values.

> If you can't sign up please contact [pit@%domain%](mailto:pit@%domain%)

**3.** You will need to add a credit/debit card when completing the registration. You may use any dummy values in these fields.

**4.** Once you've signed up you'll be redirected back to the humm portal to complete the test transaction.

You may select any options here as this is all in a sandbox environment.
