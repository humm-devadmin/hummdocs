# Introduction

We have used this API  ourselves to integrate **humm** as a payment option into a number of leading shopping cart platforms including Shopify, WooCommerce and Magento.

Shopping carts vary in how they deal with and communicate transaction information and how they classify certain bits of information as either optional or mandatory. The **humm** Checkout API is intented to work with as many shopping carts as possible (regardless of whether they are SAAS or Plugin based and regardless or the programming language used.)

In this guide, you will find instructions on the information you need to provide to **humm** and the formatting we expect. You will also find information on how to go about signing your request in order to protect against malicious attacks as well as session hijacking.
